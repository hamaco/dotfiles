;;; Commentary:

;; (For users)
;; This small tool helps you write clear bug report.
;; Just type M-x honest-report to show recent keys and screen shots.
;; Copy them into your bug report.

;; (For programmers)
;; Write a wrapper of `honest-report' with your favorite header and footer.

;; (Bug)
;; Text properties are ignored in screen shot.
;; In particular, too large region can be copied for outline-mode
;; because all closed items are shown as opened.

;;; Code:

(defun honest-report (&optional header footer)
  (interactive)
  (let ((ver (honest-report-version))
        (key (honest-report-recent-keys))
        (msg (honest-report-message))
        (scr (honest-report-screenshot)))
